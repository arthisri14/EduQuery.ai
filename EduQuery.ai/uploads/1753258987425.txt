I see you've provided detailed steps for testing the Gemini Embedding API on Replit, but I don't have a clear understanding of what specific project you want to build.

The code you've shared shows how to test Google's Gemini embedding functionality, but I need to understand your broader objective. Are you looking to:

Build a document search/similarity application using embeddings?
Create a chatbot or AI assistant that uses embeddings for context?
Develop a recommendation system?
Build a semantic search tool?
Something else entirely?
Could you please describe what you want to build with the Gemini Embedding API? For example:

What is the main purpose or functionality of your application?
Who are the intended users?
What specific features do you want to include?
Once I understand your project goals, I can create a comprehensive development plan that incorporates the Gemini Embedding API testing you've outlined.
